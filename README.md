List of 6th sem IOT/Embedded system programs
1. Programs to use GPIO with LED / Buzzer with interrupt int1/int0
2. Program to use GPIO as input from A port and display the port bit number
3. Program interrupt with port A and identify A port bit that was interrupted and increment the counter to count no of interrupts
4. Program for using ADC channel 6 and display analog value on the LCD
5. Program for using ADC channel 0 and display value on the 7 segment
6. Program pwm1 and adc channel 6 and change the illumination of led ( use ADC and PWM)
7. Using pwm0 change the illumination of external led connected to port A12
8. Using a interrupt switch on Development board and switch on/off a bulb using a relay
9. using input from the LDR switch on/off a bulb using a relay
10. using stepper motor turn 180 degree forward and backward after a delay
